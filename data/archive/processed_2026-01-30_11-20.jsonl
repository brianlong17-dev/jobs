In the second phase, which happens at the break-even point, the equity freezes at each member's current earned percentage and compensation switches to salary + benefits.

A more detailed explanation from the professor who created the model can be found on Youtube, 'Pie Slicer Equity Split Software' by Slicing Pie.\n\nWe understand the importance of work-life balance and recognize that each individual has unique scheduling needs.
